Plugin Submission Form
======================

This plugin submission form will serve as both a request to have your plugin
added to the `Rxn Rover Plugin Catalog GitHub Repository <https://github.com/
RxnRover/plugins>`_ and as the catalog entry for your plugin.

The recommended plugin submission form is available to download in the link
below. Alternatively, the verbatim text is also available below to copy/paste
into your submission form file.

Please use the following format when naming the form file, using ``snake_case``::

   <make>_<model>_<further_descriptors>_<name_or_institution_identifier>.rst

.. note::
   When naming the file, replace the parts in angled brackets ``<>`` and be
   sure to use ``snake_case`` by connecting words with an underscore ``_``
   instead of spaces.

When you are ready to submit your plugin, continue to the 
:doc:`submit_a_plugin` page.
