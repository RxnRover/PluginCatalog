This plugin allows Rxn Rover to connect with an instance of `SQSnobFit 
<https://pypi.org/project/SQSnobFit/>`_, a Python reimplementation of the 
`SNOBFIT <https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/software/snobfit/>`_ blackbox 
optimization algorithm. A Python program is provided with the plugin to launch 
an instance of SQSnobFit for use with this plugin. This program uses a
