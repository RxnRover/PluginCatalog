Getting Started
===============

Creating a Plugin
-----------------

A plugin submission begins with creating a useful plugin worth submitting! 
Tutorials for creating plugins are hosted on the `Rxn Rover documentation 
website <https://RxnRover.github.io/RxnRover/>`_. Plugins can be 
created using a `provided template <https://www.github.com/RxnRover/plugin_
generic_template>`_, or 
`completely from scratch <https://RxnRover.github.io/RxnRover/
tutorials/plugin_creation/from_scratch.html>`_ (link does not work yet. 

The plugin will also need to be available publicly, either through a GitHub 
repository, a website, or some other method.

Developing a plugin and necessary instrument drivers can take a lot of time, so
if possible, use instrument drivers available by NI through their first-party 
`NI Drivers <https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers.html>`_ or 
third-party `Instrument Driver Network <https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/
downloads/instrument-drivers.html>`_ (IDNet).

Preparing for Submission
------------------------

Once a plugin has been created, the next step is to prepare a 
:doc:`plugin_submission_form`. With a plugin and submission form, the final
step is to :doc:`submit_a_plugin`.
